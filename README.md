# Varnish_Fastly_Scan
Varnish_Fastly is a tool that scans the domain. The tool examines it carefully, and when the HTTP IP response is 200OK or 500OK, it saves it to a file. After you finish estimating or scanning, you must run the tool. And there is no internet on your phone's SIM card. You can use it for social packages to show IP. Varnish_Fastly_ There are many IP addresses that belong to Varnish_Fastly. He does this. Scan it and there is a Twitter IP or Twitter Ring. I've scanned it. There are two types of PYTHON run command files. There is a file that shows if there is an IP HTTP/.1.1 response. 200 Ok There is another file to show the response IP HTTP/1.1500 OK The results are saved each in its own file Text file 

$200 Ok 1- varnish_fastly_200ok.txt 
$ 500 Ok 2- varnish_fastly_500ok.txt 
These are save files, where there is a response to each command that will be run. Thank you, this is where I belong ♥
